# Bahram's Profile

* Built a [Terragrunt HCL parser](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/tghclparser) in TypeScript.
* Created a [VSCode extension](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/tg-hcl-lsp) with a language server for Terragrunt based on that parser.
* Made [Refac](https://jowharshamshiri.github.io/refac/), a refactoring tool for large codebases. It rewrites both file paths and contents safely. Battle-tested and in daily use.
* Forked and extended [Doxygen](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/doxygen) to support `type:` and `name:` search prefixes and boolean logic (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in external search mode.
* Built [BoxMux](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/boxmux), a YAML-driven TUI multiplexer to run and monitor groups of terminal commands in parallelâ€”ideal for devops, clusters, and testing.
