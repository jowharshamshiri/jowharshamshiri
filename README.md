# Bahram's Profile

I wrote a [parser](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/tghclparser) for Terragrunt HCL in typescript.

I created a [vscode extension](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/tg-hcl-lsp) that provides a language server for terragrunt using the above package.

I made [refac](https://jowharshamshiri.github.io/refac/), a tool I use for refactoring large projects with precision, it applies refactoring to both paths and file contents. It's tested every which way and I use it extensively myself.

Check out my fork of [doxygen](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/doxygen). I made a few small changes so that the search box in external search mode supports type: and name: prefixes. It also now supports mixing rules with boolean operators(AND, OR, NOT). You can now search for "searchkey AND NOT type:source".

Also I forked a [dark theme](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/doxygen-awesome-css) for doxygen, to make it work with v1.8.17.
