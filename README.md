# Bahram's Profile

Check out my fork of [doxygen](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/doxygen). The search box in external search mode
now supports type: and name: prefixes. It also now supports mixing rules with
boolean operators(AND, OR, NOT).

Also I forked a [dark theme](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/doxygen-awesome-css) for doxygen, to make it work with v1.8.17.

Also I am helping translate the Hugging Face course over at https://github.com/huggingface/course/issues/50
