I'm working on a vscode extension for Terragrunt HCL files.

Check out my fork of [doxygen](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/doxygen). I made a few small changes so that the search box in external search mode supports type: and name: prefixes. It also now supports mixing rules with boolean operators(AND, OR, NOT). You can now search for "searchkey AND NOT type:source".

Also I forked a [dark theme](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/doxygen-awesome-css) for doxygen, to make it work with v1.8.17.

Here's a little utility I use to manage tmux sessions: [forky](https://gist.github.com/jowharshamshiri/e55c3bbce700aa312c54f5204e7e8b36)

Here's a little utility I use to check jobs on jenkins: [jen](https://gist.github.com/jowharshamshiri/0275dbd2f4c5723956ed68f9e28a6d05)
