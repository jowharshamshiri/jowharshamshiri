# Bahram's Profile

* Built a [Terragrunt HCL parser](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/tghclparser) in TypeScript.
* Created a [VSCode extension](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/tg-hcl-lsp) with a language server for Terragrunt based on that parser.
* Made [Workspace](https://jowharshamshiri.github.io/ws/), an opinionated tool suite for file operations, version management, and development workflow automation. It’s battle-tested, used daily, and reflects years of refining my personal workflows.
* Forked and extended [Doxygen](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/doxygen) to support `type:` and `name:` search prefixes and boolean logic (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in external search mode.
* Built [BoxMux](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/boxmux), a YAML-driven TUI multiplexer to run and monitor groups of terminal commands in parallel—ideal for devops, clusters, and testing.
* Created [InSite](https://jowharshamshiri.github.io/insite), an MCP server for browser automation with 50 tools using Playwright.
* [InCode](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/incode), an MCP server providing AI agents with complete LLDB debugging capabilities for native binary debugging and analysis.
* Also check out [Bifaci](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/bifaci) - a cross-platform connection-less Unix socket communication library providing inter-process communication across Go, Rust, Swift, and TypeScript.
